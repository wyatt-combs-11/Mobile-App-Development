# CSE382-Summer-2022

## Description
This repository details my mobile app development course path. Projects are the larger culmination of my learning with the DXD being my most current and latest project. Most of the GUI design was not covered and self-learned. The course exercises and projects help display new concepts to me such as asynchronous logic, responsive layouts, lambda expressions (love these), dependency services, and much more. NOTE: Apps are made with Xamarin Framework.

## Visuals
COMING SOON

## Installation
All projects are done in Visual Studio and only need to be downloaded.

## Usage
The projects are basic apps and console applications. Iphone or Android emulator recommended for best experience of Xamarin Apps.

## Roadmap
Almost all projects are finished in their respective goals for learning. Projects, specifically DXD Labs, are planned to be improved upon and hopefully published to app store in future.

## Contributing
Open to contributions in any projects as learning experience for myself and ideas to improve upon within projects.

## Project status
Mostly closed except for projects such as DXD Labs which are planned to be developed and published to app store.
