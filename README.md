# CSE382-Summer-2022

## Description
This repository details my mobile app development course path. Projects are the larger culmination of my learning with the DXD being my most current and latest project. Most of the GUI design was not covered and self-learned. The course exercises and projects help display new concepts to me such as asynchronous logic, responsive layouts, lambda expressions (love these), dependency services, and much more. NOTE: Apps are made with Xamarin Framework.
